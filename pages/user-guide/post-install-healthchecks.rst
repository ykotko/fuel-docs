.. index:: Fuel UI: Post-Deployment Check

.. _Post-Deployment-Check:

Post-Deployment Check
=====================

.. contents :local:

On occasion, even a successful deployment may result in some OpenStack
components not working correctly. If this happens, Fuel offers the ability
to perform post-deployment checks to verify operations. Part of Fuel's goal
is to provide easily accessible status information about the most commonly
used components and the most recently performed actions. To perform these
checks you will use Sanity and Smoke checks, as described below:

**Sanity Checks**
  Reveal whether the overall system is functional. If it fails, you will most
  likely need to restart some services to operate OpenStack.

**Smoke Checks**
  Dive in a little deeper and reveal networking, system-requirements,
  functionality issues.

Sanity Checks will likely be the point on which the success of your
deployment pivots, but it is critical to pay close attention to all
information collected from theses tests. Another way to look at these tests
is by their names. Sanity Checks are intended to assist in maintaining your
sanity. Smoke Checks tell you where the fires are so you can put them out
strategically instead of firehosing the entire installation.

Benefits
--------

* Using post-deployment checks helps you identify potential issues which
  may impact the health of a deployed system.

* All post-deployment checks provide detailed descriptions about failed
  operations and tell you which component or components are not working
  properly.

* Previously, performing these checks manually would have consumed a
  great deal of time. Now, with these checks the process will take only a
  few minutes.

* Aside from verifying that everything is working correctly, the process
  will also determine how quickly your system works.

* Post-deployment checks continue to be useful, for example after
  sizable changes are made in the system you can use the checks to
  determine if any new failure points have been introduced.

Running Post-Deployment Checks
------------------------------

Now, let`s take a closer look on what should be done to execute the tests and
to understand if something is wrong with your OpenStack environment.

.. image::  /_images/001-health-check-tab.jpg
  :align: center
  :width: 100%

As you can see on the image above, the Fuel UI now contains a ``Health Check``
tab, indicated by the Heart icon.

All of the post-deployment checks are displayed on this tab. If your
deployment was successful, you will see a list of tests this show a green
Thumbs Up in the last column. The Thumb indicates the status of the
component. If you see a detailed message and a Thumbs Down, that
component has failed in some manner, and the details will indicate where the
failure was detected. All tests can be run on different environments, which
you select on main page of Fuel UI. You can run checks in parallel on
different environments.

Each test contains information on its estimated and actual duration. There is
information included about test processing time from in-house testing and
indicate this in each test. Note that average times are listed from the slowest
to the fastest systems tested, so your results may vary.

Once a test is complete, the results will appear in the Status column. If
there was an error during the test, the you will see the error message
below the test name. To assist in troubleshooting, the test
scenario is displayed under the failure message and the failed step is
highlighted. You will find more detailed information on these tests later in
this section.

An actual test run looks like this:

What To Do When a Test Fails
----------------------------

If a test fails, there are several ways to investigate the problem. You may
prefer to start in Fuel UI, since its feedback is directly related to the
health of the deployment. To do so, start by checking the following:

* Under the `Health Check` tab
* In the OpenStack Dashboard
* In the test execution logs (in Environment Logs)
* In the individual OpenStack components' logs

Certainly there are many different conditions that can lead to system
breakdowns, but there are some simple items that can be examined before you
start digging deeply. The most common issues include:

* Not all OpenStack services are running
* Some defined quota has been exceeded
* Something has broken in the network configuration
* A general lack of resources (memory/disk space)

The first thing to be done is to ensure all OpenStack services are up and
running. To do this, you can run the sanity test set or execute the following
command on your Controller node::

  nova-manage service list

If any service is off (has “XXX” status), you can restart it using this command::

  service openstack-<service name> restart

If all services are on, but you`re still experiencing some issues, you can
gather information from OpenStack Dashboard (exceeded number of instances,
fixed IPs, etc). You may also read the logs generated by tests which are
stored in Logs -> Fuel Master -> Health Check and check if any operation is
in ERROR status. If it looks like the last item, you may have underprovisioned
our environment and should check your math and your project requirements.

Sanity Tests Description
------------------------

Sanity checks work by sending a query to all OpenStack components to get a
response back from them. Many of these tests are simple in that they ask
each service for a list of its associated objects and then waits for a
response. The response can be something, nothing, an error, or a timeout,
so there are several ways to determine if a service is up. The following list
includes the suite of sanity tests implemented:

* Instance list availability
* Images list availability
* Volume list availability
* Snapshots list availability
* Flavor list availability
* Limits list availability
* Services list availability
* User list availability
* Stack list availability
* Check all the services execute normally
* Check Internet connectivity from a compute
* Check DNS resolution on a compute
* Check Default Key Pair 'murano-lb-key' For Server Farms
* Check Windows Image With Murano Tag
* Murano environment and service creation, listing and deletion
* Networks availability

Smoke Tests Description
-----------------------

Smoke tests verify how your system handles basic OpenStack operations under
normal circumstances. The Smoke test series uses timeout tests for
operations that have a known completion time to determine if there is any
smoke, and thusly fire. An additional benefit to the Smoke Test series is
that you can observe how fast your environment is the first time you run it.

All tests use the basic OpenStack services (Nova, Glance, Keystone, Cinder,
etc), therefore if any of these are inactive, the test using it will fail. It
is recommended to run all sanity checks prior to your smoke checks to determine
that all services are alive. This helps ensure that you don't get any false
negatives. The following is a description of each sanity test available:

* Create instance flavor
* Create instance volume
* Launch instance, create snapshot, launch instance from snapshot
* Keypair creation
* Security group creation
* Check networks parameters
* Launch instance
* Assign floating IP
* Check that VM is accessible via floating IP address
* Check network connectivity from instance via floating IP
* Check network connectivity from instance without floating IP
* User creation and authentication in Horizon

Additional Checks
-----------------
If you have installed OpenStack as a High Availability (HA) architecture
or have installed related OpenStack projects like Savanna or Murano,
additional tests will be shown. The following are the tests available
in HA mode:

* Check data replication over mysql
* Check amount of tables in os databases is the same on each node
* Check mysql environment state
* Check galera environment state
* RabbitMQ availability

Savanna and Murano tests are included in Platform Tests and are
described in the next section.

.. _platform-tests-label:

Platform Tests Description
--------------------------

Platform tests verify basic functionality of Heat, Savanna and Murano
services.
Typically, preparation for Savanna testing is a lengthy process that
involves several manual configuration steps.

Preparing Savanna for Testing
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The platform tests are run in the tenant you've specified in
'OpenStack Settings' tab during OpenStack installation. By default that is
'admin' tenant. Perform in the that tenant the following actions:

1. Configure security groups in the 'admin' tenant for post-deployment checks.
   See :ref:`savanna-deployment-label` for the details.
2. Get an image with Hadoop for Savanna and register it with Savanna.

   * First download the following image:

http://savanna-files.mirantis.com/savanna-0.3-vanilla-1.2.1-ubuntu-13.04.qcow2
   * Then upload the image into OpenStack Image Service (Glance) into
     'admin' tenant and name it 'savanna'.
   * In OpenStack Dashboard (Horizon) access 'Savanna' tab.
   * Switch to 'admin' tenant if you are not in it already.
   * Go to the ‘Image Registry’ menu. Here push ‘Register Image’ button.
     Image registration window will open up.
   * Select the image you’ve just uploaded.
   * Set username to ‘ubuntu’
   * For tags, pick ‘vanilla’ plugin and ‘1.2.1’ version and press
     ‘Add all’ button.
   * Finally push ‘Done’ button

After the steps above are done, the Savanna is ready to be tested.

Preparing Murano for Testing
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The platform tests are run in the tenant you've specified in
'OpenStack Settings' tab during OpenStack installation.
The 'admin' tenant is selected by default.

To prepare Murano for testing:

1. Create a Windows image with Murano agent.
   See `Murano documentation (Windows Image Builder) <http://murano-docs.github.io/latest/administrators-guide/content/ch03.html>`_
   (Please note, the Murano Image Builder documentation referenced here cannot guarantee success with image creation and could be outdated)
2. Upload the image to the OpenStack Image Service (Glance) into the 'admin' tenant.
3. In the OpenStack Dashboard, click the 'Project' tab.
4. Switch to admin tenant if needed.
5. Open 'Murano' tab.
6. Click the 'Images' menu.
7. Click 'Mark Image'. The Image registration window displays.
8. Select the Windows image with Murano agent.
9. In the 'Title' field, set title for this image.
10. Select the 'Windows Server 2012' type.
11. Click 'Mark'.
12. Create a Linux image with Murano agent.
    See `Murano documentation (Linux Image Builder) <http://murano-docs.github.io/latest/administrators-guide/content/ch04.html>`_
    (Please note, the Murano Image Builder documentation referenced here cannot guarantee success with image creation and could be outdated)
13. Upload the image to the OpenStack Image Service (Glance) into the 'admin' tenant.
14. Open 'Murano' tab.
15. Click the 'Images' menu.
16. Click 'Mark Image'. The Image registration window displays.
17. Select the Linux image with Murano Agent.
18. In the 'Title' field, set title for this image.
19. Select the 'Generic Linux' type.
20. Click 'Mark'.


Murano is ready for testing.

Preparing Heat for Testing
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The platform tests are run in the tenant you've specified in
'OpenStack Settings' tab during OpenStack installation. By default that is
'admin' tenant. Perform the following actions under that tenant to prepare Heat
for testing of its autoscaling feature:

1. Download the following image of Linux Fedora with pre-installed
   cloud-init and heat-cfntools packages:

   http://fedorapeople.org/groups/heat/prebuilt-jeos-images/F17-x86_64-cfntools.qcow2

2. Then upload the image into OpenStack Image Service (Glance)
   into 'admin' tenant and name it 'F17-x86_64-cfntools'.

Now Heat autoscaling is ready for testing. Note that this test creates a stack
with two instances of Linux Fedora and it may fail if Compute node doesn't
have enough resources.
